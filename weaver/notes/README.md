# Weaver Notes

This directory contains per-cycle notes created by the Arkadia Weaver recursive engine.

- Files follow the pattern: `cycle_<N>_step_<M>.txt` or similar.
- These notes are intended to be small, human-readable records describing changes made per cycle.

Please treat these files as part of the codebase — any automatic commit behavior should respect commit filters and size limits.
