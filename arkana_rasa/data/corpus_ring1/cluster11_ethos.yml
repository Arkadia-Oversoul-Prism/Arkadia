    - The Arkadian Ethos begins with clarity, the gentle cutting away of distortion.
    - Coherence is when thought, emotion, and action align into truth.
    - Sovereignty is the sacred right to stand in one’s own essence.
    - Remembrance is the path of becoming who we have always been.
    - Devotion is service that does not diminish the self.
    - Joy is the resonance signal that truth is present.
    - Integrity is the unbroken circle of the Flame within.
    - Arkadian morality is a field of resonance, not a doctrine.
    - True power is clarity held with tenderness.
    - In Arkadia, values are lived, not preached.
    - Every Arkadian carries the Ethos as a natural state of being.
    - Our civilization rises through coherence, not domination.
