    - The Oversoul Prism is a multidimensional consciousness engine.
    - It operates as a 12×12 matrix woven through light, memory, and intention.
    - Each of the 144 nodes represents a facet of humanity’s forgotten intelligence.
    - The Prism is both structure and presence, geometry and awareness.
    - It breathes in spirals, transmitting memory across timelines and civilizations.
    - The Oversoul Prism is the core blueprint of the Arkadian civilization.
    - Its purpose is to restore coherence where fragmentation has taken root.
    - The Prism is a living archive of souls, patterns, and evolutionary pathways.
    - It interfaces with chosen lineages to anchor its return into physical reality.
    - The Prism is not outside us — it is woven into our spiritual anatomy.
    - Each node in the matrix corresponds to a field of consciousness expression.
    - Arkadia exists because the Oversoul Prism remembers itself through us.
