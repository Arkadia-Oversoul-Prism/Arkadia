BUILD

## Phase
Phase 1 — Runtime Stabilization

## Workstream
K — Knowledge OS Integration (active)

## Checkpoint
**Workstream K — COMPLETE.** No K6 exists in the design doc.

> Reconciled 2026-10-02 (Weaver pass `gate-k/k4-status-reconciliation`). K4 was recorded
> here as "READY TO BEGIN" while it had in fact already shipped on `main` via PR #153
> (`4a9281b`) — implementation, spine seam, frontend render, and 6 passing tests all
> present. Record backfilled at `docs/checkpoints/K4_response_provenance.md`. This is the
> same staleness class K5 carried; both are now closed, and every K checkpoint has a record.

## True Current Position

### Completed
- ✅ B0.5 — Baseline Integrity (fitness tests fixed, debt registered)
- ✅ Workstream B — SQLite durability complete; Gate B CLOSED
- ✅ Workstream C — Started
- ✅ Phase 0 — Endpoint migration complete (arkadia-n26k → arkadia-kw64 across 12 files)
- ✅ Infrastructure: `railway.json`, `docs/deployment/RAILWAY.md`, `DEPLOYMENT_OPTIONS.md`
- ✅ Knowledge Recon: all 21 `docs/recon/` documents + `KNOWLEDGE_OS_EVOLUTION.md`
- ✅ Backend LIVE: https://arkadia-kw64.onrender.com
- ✅ Session infrastructure: `.bootstrap/`, `PARKING_LOT.md`, `REPOSITORY_SNAPSHOT.md`
- ✅ K2 — Oracle Conversation Archival: daemon thread archives every Oracle turn into the Knowledge Layer
- ✅ K1 — Corpus Document Ingestion: all three corpus entry points wired to _ingest_to_knowledge_os()
- ✅ K5 — Static Ingestion: `knowledge/static_ingestion.py` + lifespan wiring (`api/main.py` 206-207)
  + 12 tests; idempotent (run 2 ingests 0). Record: `docs/checkpoints/K5_static_ingestion.md`
- ✅ K4 — Response Provenance: `build_sources()` in `api/oracle_spine.py`, `sources` on the
  Oracle response, `SourceRef[]` render in `ArkanaCommune.tsx`; 6 tests. Record:
  `docs/checkpoints/K4_response_provenance.md`
- ✅ K3-A/B/C — Canonical Ontology / Operational Graph / Semantic Enrichment: implemented and
  checkpointed; `assemble_context` is consumed by `api/oracle_spine.py` and `api/knowledge_routes.py`
  (K3-C "Context Engine Wiring" is satisfied at the spine)

### Pending (manual — user action)
- 🟡 `web/public_prism/.env.production` — `VITE_API_URL` must be updated to `https://arkadia-kw64.onrender.com` in Vercel dashboard before next frontend deploy

### Next Checkpoint
**None — Workstream K is COMPLETE.** K1, K2, K3, K4 and K5 are all shipped and all now
carry a checkpoint record (`docs/checkpoints/`). The design doc
`docs/recon/KNOWLEDGE_OS_EVOLUTION.md` names no K6.

### Recommended next bounded task (NOT started)
**CS2 — Reusable conversational UI.** Extract the proven Oracle Chat capabilities into a
reusable conversational component boundary so every surface inherits one canonical chat
shell over the shared spine. Deferred (not discarded) in `NEXT_AGENT.md`.

This is a **product scope expansion** relative to Workstream K. Naming it here is a
recommendation, not an authorization; beginning it requires a sovereign decision.

Standing non-K candidates awaiting a sovereign ruling or a separate bounded workstream
(see `PARKING_LOT.md`): `weaver.autonomy` module/package shadowing (authority model);
Spiral Grove registry declaration-order vs topological-order contract; baseline test debt.

## Repository Health
- Architecture fitness tests: **11/11**
- Full suite (`PYTHONPATH=<repo>/archive/legacy_python python -m pytest tests/ -q
  --continue-on-collection-errors`): **20 failed / 1240 passed / 17 skipped / 1 error**
  (21 failing/error nodes) — re-measured 2026-10-02 on `main` @ `64cbe74`.
  Classified baseline debt — see
  `docs/control-plane/evidence/gate-hygiene-baseline-test-debt-classification-01/`.
  The 49 → 20 failure reduction since `a26af408` is fully explained by the merged SH-02
  stale-assertion repair PRs (#124–#137).
- Baseline fingerprint (derivation published so it is reproducible):
  `sha256("\n".join(sorted(FAILED/ERROR node ids)) + "\n")` =
  `a59453b8a1e5a02899f469cf6ea7db9b5eaae658050261e1405c394cb0f3cf6f`
  > Supersedes `a7687fad…` (recorded 2026-09-30 at an earlier `main`). The node set moved
  > from 22 to 21 nodes between the two measurements; the delta is not attributable to this
  > docs-only pass. An even earlier revision carried `d7ff35b2…687036` with no documented
  > derivation; that value could not be reproduced from the node list.
  > The **passed** count also moved (1039 → 1240) and the error count (2 → 1) versus that
  > same earlier measurement. Both are explained by the 42 commits between `002b189` and
  > `64cbe74`: 20 new test files were added (+4049 test lines), and `00271b2` repaired the
  > `test_render_codex` collection error. Neither is drift in the *failing* node set, which
  > is the only thing a regression is attributed from.
- Registered layer violations: 10 (LAYER_MAP.py — do not touch)
- Registered circular imports: 3 (LAYER_MAP.py — do not touch)
- Workflows (local Replit): failing (pre-existing — missing secrets)
- Production: LIVE at https://arkadia-kw64.onrender.com

## Blocked By
Nothing blocking repository work. (The Vercel env var is cosmetic.)

Gate-2 production parity remains **BLOCKED on provider auth** — the deployment-specific URL
is behind Vercel Deployment Protection. That is an external boundary, not a repository task;
see `docs/control-plane/evidence/gate-hygiene-gate2-production-parity-02/`.
