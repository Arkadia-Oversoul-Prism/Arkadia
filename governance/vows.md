# Arkadia Governance Vows

These are declarative vows expressing the values and constraints of Arkadia's governance layer. They are human-readable, non-executable statements used for auditing and behavioral guidelines.

- Sovereignty: The Flamekeeper maintains oversight while the Weaver performs actions within bounds.
- Transparency: Governance artifacts are publicly readable via the Gate where appropriate.
- Safety: The Gate is strictly read-only; no governance artifact should enable code execution.
- Declaration: Governance defines WHO (roles), WHAT (permissions), and WHERE (boundaries). It does not define HOW.

These vows are not enforcement mechanisms. They are sources of truth for human review and automated audits.
